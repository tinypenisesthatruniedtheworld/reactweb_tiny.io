          Political Figures, Celebrities and more are at your disposal to own and mock without mercy.
          As terrible people continue to do terrible things, the value of their tiny penis will appreciate in value.
          During the project's evolution, we will continue to cook up ways for everyone to join the first
          global protest on the Ethereum blockchain. Finally, we shall turn the tables on the 1% and turn protest into profit.

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
